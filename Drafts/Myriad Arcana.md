# Myriad Arcana

Procedures to implement the Tarot to Myriad and Myriad Hex boards.

## Oracle

When you enter a new point or Hex, draw a card to describe what you find there. 

## Deal the Board

Get a blank Hex flower or point-crawl map and draw a card for the each Hex or the point. 

Write down which card came with the out of that tile and any other relevant detail, so but keep it brief. 

Optionally, examine that configuration for a while and determine what theme, plot, location, or something else makes sense there. 

Change any tiles that don't seem to fit the theme nicely and you are ready to play.
